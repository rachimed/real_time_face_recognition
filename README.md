Description:
This project implements a real-time facial recognition system in Python. It consists of three main scripts that work together to collect data, train a facial recognition model,
and perform real-time recognition.

Features:
Data Collection: A Python script that launches the computer's camera, detects faces, and builds a training dataset.
Model Training: Uses the collected dataset along with computer vision libraries to train a facial recognition model.
real-time_face_recognition: Utilizes a robust pre-trained model (FaceNet) to perform facial recognition.
